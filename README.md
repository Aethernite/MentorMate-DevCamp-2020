# MentorMate - DevCamp - 2020
Created during 2020 for the MentorMate 2020 devcamp.

## Description

This repository contains all of the homework given by MentorMate during the Devcamp of 2020. The Devcamp consisted of three modules:
- Basic Module
- Back-End Module (Java)
- Front-End Module (ReactJS)

Each folder represents a different homework. During the devcamp we worked using agile methodologies and tools like Jira. That's the main reason why each folder is stamped with the number of the Jira ticket. During the devcamp I learned about Java and ReactJS and how to work with the git flow technique.
